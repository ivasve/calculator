# calculator

<i>By Ivana Jones</i></br>
This calculator was created by following a manual on Freecodecamp.org website (here - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98/ ).

<strong>FUNCTIONS:</strong></br>

This calculator is able to do basic calculations (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication). It clears the data with two different functions (clears just one number, or clears the whole calculation). It is possible to do calculations with numbers with decimal points. When a number divides by zero the "Error" text is displayed.

<strong>HTML:</strong></br>

Data attributes is used ('data-action') for operators, decimal, clear, and equal button - it is semantic HTML which allows to add more information/attributes to the HTML element (this information is not displayed). In JS this can be used together with Event listeners. Read more information about HTML Data attributes here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes

<strong>JavaScript</strong></br>

Detailed comments are added into the index.js file to explain the single steps.
